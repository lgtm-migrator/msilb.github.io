I would like to welcome you all on my new website. In this blog you will find posts on topics related to things I know best, namely functional programming (Scala in particular), web development, world of finance and trading. I will also occasionally post here photos from my trips around the world. Meanwhile feel free to check out my projects on GitHub:

* [Akka Trading](https://github.com/msilb/akka-trading) - Scala Backtesting + Oanda REST API Trading Framework built on top of Akka/Spray
* [QuantCloud Web](https://github.com/msilb/quantcloud-web) - Experimental HTML5 front-end for yield curve calculation engine, based on gridster.js and Highcharts
